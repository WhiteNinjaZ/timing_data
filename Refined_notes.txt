It looks like there is only one switch in VTR to describe the switch to connect from CLB to routing and 
from wire to wire.

There is an <opin_switch name="string"/> for bi-directional only which is a CB type thing.

Instead of doing a single Tdel you can specify seperate Tdel for a specific number of inputs.

We might have to do all of our timming external as internal. 
<direct name="adder_carry" from_pin="clb.cout" to_pin="clb.cin" x_offset="0" y_offset="-1" z_offset="0"/>


I believe this is correct. We could override every switch too using switch_override in custom sb but at that
point it would be better to just modify vtr to specify different CB and SB switches.

^^^ To figure out if this needs to happen we need to find SD and info about switch block connections.
